# Wave

A simple wave file decoder written in go

This is just me experimenting with decoding file formats and what it's like
I'm really using this so I can splice up various audio files, and I will be 
getting to that point soon!

### Todo

Expose a struct with functions to act upon
Make some abstractions for mp3 too
Please give me more ideas.
